    <H5>How I got into playing video games</H5>
    I got into playing video games when I was a kid. From the earliest memories I can think I have always played some type of videos from a psp, nintendo ds, wii, and playstation growing up.
    <H5>Why I enjoy playing video games</H5>
    I enjoy playing video games because they are a great way to relax and have fun. I love the challenge of trying to beat a difficult level or opponent, and the feeling of accomplishment when
    I finally succeed. Video games are also a great way to connect with friends and family, and I love playing online with other people. Overall, video games are a fun and enjoyable hobby that I will continue to enjoy for many years to come.
