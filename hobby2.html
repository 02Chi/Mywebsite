        <H5>How I got into collecting</H5>
        With poekmon cards it started with me going to a summer camp and most the kids there battled and traded most of the camp. So that led me to start buying them also. With vehicles, I started collecting them when I was a kid. I would get them as gifts and buy them from the store. With sports cards, I started collecting them when I was a kid.

        <H5>Why I enjoy collecting</H5>
        I enjoy collecting because it is a fun and rewarding hobby. I love the thrill of finding a rare or valuable item, and the satisfaction of adding it to my collection. Collecting also allows me to learn more about the things I am interested in, and to connect with other collectors who share my passion. Overall, collecting is a great way to relax and have fun, and I will continue to enjoy it for many years to come.
